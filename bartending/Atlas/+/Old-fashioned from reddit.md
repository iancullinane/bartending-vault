2 ounces old grandad bourbon (I use 80 proof)

1/4 ounce maple syrup

2 dashes angostura bitters

2 dashes orange bitters (I use fee brothers but have also tried regans and both work).

I ALWAYS build it in a shaker tin, mix it without any ice and then pour the liquid over top of a large ice cube in the glass. I also dehydrate orange slices as garnish and I make my own luxardo cherries. But an expressed orange peel is great too.

The keys are the maple syrup and building it without diluting it at all. it made all the difference.
