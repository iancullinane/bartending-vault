A lime cordial created in the 19th Century to preserve lime juice for long sea voyages. 

The modern version is pretty dreadful. However [[Jeffrey Morganthaler]] had made a recipe. 

### [Homemade](https://jeffreymorgenthaler.com/lime-cordial/)

##### One

Weigh out your sugar. If you don’t have a scale it’s about 8 oz/240 ml. But I always recommend the weighing.

##### Two

Grate some lime peel. It’s about one large or two small limes’ worth of peel. Get yourself a microplane. I use mine all the time and they’re cheap.

##### Three

Squeeze the lime juice. Again, it’s about one large or two small limes’ worth of juice. Convenient, no?

##### Four

Measure out the citric acid. Self-explanatory.

##### Five

Get that water hot. Doesn’t need to be a rolling boil, just good and hot. And yes, you can do this in a minute and a half in the microwave. This is exactly what a microwave is for.

##### Six

Mix it all together. You can let it sit for days and days to infuse that lime peel into the syrup, or you can throw it in a blender on medium speed for about 30 seconds. Guess which method I prefer?

##### Seven

Strain it with a fine-mesh strainer and bottle it. That’s it!
