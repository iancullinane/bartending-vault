Mezcal is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from the agave plant that originated in Mexico: 

- **Production**
    
    Mezcal is made by roasting the agave plant in underground pits, which gives it a smoky flavor. The roasted agave is then mashed, fermented, and distilled. 
    

- **Agave**
    
    Mezcal can be made from over 30 different types of agave, unlike tequila, which is made only from the blue agave. 
    

- **Flavor**
    
    Mezcal can taste sweet, fruity, earthy, or smoky, and may also have notes of vanilla, clove, citrus, florals, or herbs. 
    

- **Drinking**
    
    Mezcal is best consumed neat, but it can also be mixed in cocktails. Most mezcals are consumed young, straight from distillation, but some are barrel-aged in wood.
