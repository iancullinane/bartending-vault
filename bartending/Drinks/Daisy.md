A [[mother recipe]] that is the basis for drinks like [[Margarita]], [[Cosmopolitan ]], and [[Sidecar]].

It is made from [[spirit]], [[citrus]], and [[sugar]].

It is very similar to a [[Daiquiri]]. [[The main difference between a daiquiri and a daisy]] is the kind of sweetener. If it is a syrup or liqueur it is a Daisy.
